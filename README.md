# FPA-Waste-Elimination

## Overview

This was a project assigned to my team within the Career Opportunities and Management  
Employment Training [(COMET) Program](https://jobs.applied.com/content/College-Recruiting/?locale=en_US). We had to build our project around acheiving one of three things:  

1. Identify business processes that can be improved to eliminate rework and waste
2. Free up resources
3. Improve customer Experience 

Lastly, we presented our findings directly to the Board of Directors and held a Q & A session.

## Objective

Of the above we chose to identify a business process that needs improvement, suggest a change, and  
estimate the net effects of said changes. We slected was the *Field Product Add* process, which  
occurs when a customer needs us to source an item that is not in our system. During this process,  
questions need to be answered such as:

Is this product still manufactured?
Who are the vendors and do we have permission to buy directly?
Which vendors sell at the best price?
Are there any order minimums & what do we do with the surplus supply?
How do we add this to our system to allow for future reference?

**Although I can not upload the raw company data, I can summarize our findings and share the  
strategies we implemented, as well as most of our presentation slides.**  

## Methods

First we devised a survey that would be sent to 18 locations throughout the country that  
instructs inside sales to note the FPAs they source, how long it took to source that item,  
what resource was used, who the vendor(s) are and other info relevant to the objective questions.  

We predicted that employee years of experience and source used would have significant effects on  
the time it takes to source FPAs, so those were also two fields we required. Over a one week period,  
18 service centers throughout the US collected this info for our analysis. We then used various  
calculations and charts to visualize our findings.  

## Findings

I found that out initial predictions were not all correct. While product category and resource used  
had significant effects on FPA time, employee experience did not. This was a surprise,
