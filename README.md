# FPA-Waste-Elimination

## Overview

This was a project assigned to my team within the Career Opportunities and Management  
Employment Training [(COMET) Program](https://jobs.applied.com/content/College-Recruiting/?locale=en_US). We had to build our project around achieving one of three things:  

1. Identify business processes that can be improved to eliminate rework and waste  
2. Free up resources  
3. Improve customer Experience  

Lastly, we presented our findings directly to the Board of Directors and held a Q & A session.  

## Objective

Of the above we chose to identify a business process that needs improvement, suggest a change, and  
estimate the net effects of said changes. We selected was the *Field Product Add* process, which  
occurs when a customer needs us to source an item that is not in our system. During this process,  
questions need to be answered such as:  

Is this product still manufactured?  
Who are the vendors and do we have permission to buy directly?  
Which vendors sell at the best price?  
Are there any order minimums & what do we do with the surplus supply?  
How do we add this to our system to allow for future reference?  

**Although I can't upload the raw company data, I can summarize our findings and share the  
strategies we implemented, as well as most of our presentation slides.**  

## Methods

First, we devised a survey that would be sent to 18 locations throughout the country that    
instructs inside sales to note the FPAs they source, how long it took to source that item,  
what resource was used, who the vendor(s) are and other info relevant to the objective questions.  

We predicted that employee years of experience and source used would have significant effects on  
the time it takes to source FPAs, so those were also two fields we required. Over a one week period,  
18 service centers throughout the US collected this info for our analysis. We then used various  
calculations and charts to visualize our findings.  

## Findings

Our initial predictions were not all correct. 3 of the 50 product categories involving miscellaneous  
items contained 40% of the FPAs. For example, the most common were misc Specialty and Liquid Power  
products.

The most common Resources used to source a FPA were Google, a vendor, and "tribal knowledge", which  
was defined as knowledge acquired from another employee directly. Since 80% of FPAs were sourced  
using one of these three methods I did further analysis provided some comparisons:

Surprisingly, employee experience did not have a significant effect on FPA Turnaround time.

From my experience, I still believed employee experience had a significant effect on the FPA  
process, so I looked at a few more metrics and discovered a key finding:  
Although more experience didn't improve an employee's FPA turnaround time, it made them much  
less likely to use tribal knowledge in the first place, and much more likely to source an item  
on their own:

Projecting our survey data over the company's sales volume I estimated that for every minute  
we can reduce the FPA process across the company's ~661,000+ FPAs we would save 11,030 man-hours!  
Additional benefits could include faster quote turnaround, leading to higher customer retantion  
for both loyal and prospective customers!

## Resolutions

Our suggested resolutions were the Knowledge Bank and the Product Identification Guide, or PIG.  
The Knowledge bank would consolidate items that were added to the system many times in an  
online database. Across the company, employees would often add the same item with a slightly  
different name or category because the employee was unaware it was already in the system.  
This can lead to sourcing said item from a more expensive vendor or not locating the vendor  
in time to meet our customer's needs. The product identification guide is a resource for  
capturing the required info from the customer or directly from the part that needs replacing.  
This is an example of a PIG page for ball bearings:

***By capturing "tribal knowledge" before it leaves the company, preventing duplicate FPAs, and  
creating a PIG we have the potential to:***  

- Free up over 50,000 man-hours  
- Increase quote turnaround time  
- Consolidate on the most profitable vendors to increase profit margin
